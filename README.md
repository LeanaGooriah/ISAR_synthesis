# Synthesis 

## Description

This repository contains the raw data and code used to reproduce the analyses from the article: 
**"Synthesis reveals that island species-area relationships emerge from processes beyond passive sampling"**.

## Reproducibility and R environment

To ensure that the working environment (R version and package version) are documented and isolated, the package renv (https://rstudio.github.io/renv/index.html) was used. By running `renv::restore()`, renv will install all missing packages at once. This function will use the renv.lock file to download the same versions of packages that we used.
